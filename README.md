## Concepts:

- Script kiddie: an individual with limited knowledge of hacking and cybersecurity who uses pre-made scripts or tools to launch attacks on networks or systems. They typically lack the skills to develop their own hacking methods or to understand the intricacies of the systems they exploit. Their actions are often motivated by a desire for attention or mischief rather than sophisticated objectives. The term is derogatory, emphasizing their superficial understanding and approach to hacking.
- Web Application Firewall (WAF): a security tool that filters and monitors HTTP traffic to and from a web application to protect against web-based attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and others. It operates by applying a set of rules to identify and block malicious traffic, ensuring the security of web applications. WAFs can be implemented as hardware, software, or as a cloud service, offering versatile protection options for web applications.
- weakest link: the most vulnerable component within a security system or network that could be exploited by threats or attacks. This vulnerability could be due to a variety of factors, including outdated software, weak passwords, insufficient security policies, or human error.
